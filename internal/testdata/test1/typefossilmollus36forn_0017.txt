FORNEY & NITECKI: FOSSIL MOLLUSCA 5 

Sayre (1931) also published an abstract of his thesis with many nomina 
 nuda, but the names became available a few months later when the 
 monographic version (1930) [1931] of his thesis appeared. 

Smith (1935, unpub.) wrote a Ph.D thesis on the fauna of the Buck- 
 horn Asphah, Oklahoma. The fauna included seven gastropods, none of 
 which were new species. The descriptions of the nautiloids and ammo- 
 noids, along with a list of the other species, were published (Smith, 1938) 
 as a "Private edition, distributed by the University of Chicago Library." 
 According to records in the University Dissertation Office, this edition 
 consisted of 116 copies. One copy was deposited in the University Li- 
 brary, and the rest were exchanged with other libraries. Thus the require- 
 ments for valid publication under the Rules of Zoological Nomenclature 
 were fulfilled. For example, the new genera of ammonoids described by 
 Smith (1938) are also discussed by Miller etal. (1957, pp. L61, L66). 

Many specialists have given us advice in documenting systematic 
 changes of species not included in the various bibliographic indices. We 
 thank Drs. R. L. Batten, R. G. Clements, R. M. Linsley, K. V. W. 
 Palmer, B. Patterson, J. S. Peel, A. J. Rowell, A. G. Smith, N. F. Sohl, 
 C. Teichert, E. H. Yokes, and E. L. Yochelson. Irene Ludwig prepared 
 the index of species. 

This work was supported by a University of Chicago Natural History 
 Museum Fellowship, 1973-1975, and by a grant to study the Wing Col- 
 lection from the Student Aid Fund, Department of Geology, Academy 
 of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, both to the senior author.
