INTRODUCTION 

Living molluscs are commonly divided into three major classes (Gas- 
 tropoda, Cephalopoda, and Bivalvia), and four minor classes (Mono- 
 placophora, Polyplacophora, Scaphopoda, and Aplacophora). Although 
 many extinct classes of molluscs have been proposed, the generally 
 accepted ones are Hyolitha (Marek, 1963), Mattheva (Yochclson, 1966), 
 Stenothecoida (Yochelson, 1969), and Rostroconchia (Pojeta et al., 
 1972). 

This catalogue lists the type and referred specimens of fossils repre- 
 senting five of these 1 1 molluscan classes. These are: Hyolitha, Poly- 
 placophora, Scaphopoda, Monoplacophora, and Gastropoda. Individual 
 specimens are assigned to these sections solely on the basis of their 
 original generic name. No specimens were reassigned in connection with 
 this work. The hyolithid genera listed include Hyolithes, Pharetrclla, 
 and Theca. The polyplacophoran generic names are Chiton and Helmin- 
 thochiton. The scaphopods were originally described as Denialiiim and 
 Laevidentalium. The genera of Monoplacophora are Archinacella, 
 Helcionopsis, and Tryhlidium. Cyrtolites (Cyrtonella) pilcolus was 
 described as a gastropod. It was later placed with the monoplacophor- 
 ans. Therefore, it is listed in both relevant sections. Our catalogue is di- 
 vided into five sections representing each of the five classes; both original 
 fossil material and artificial casts are included. 

Most of the specimens listed were originally in the collections of the 
 Walker Museum of Paleontology (prefixed UC) of the University of 
 Chicago; this material is now on permanent loan to Field Museum. The 
 other specimens (prefixed P or PE) were deposited directly into the Field 
 Museum collections. 

A type catalogue is a list of specimens, not of species. Therefore, this 
 catalogue includes a few annelids, brachiopods, and cephalopods that 
 were erroneously described as "gastropods." The correct assignment of 
 these specimens is noted. 

We recognize only holotypes and lectoiypes as valid types. All other 
 so-called primary and secondary types are listed as referred specimens.
