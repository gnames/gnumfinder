FORNEY & NITECKI: FOSSIL MOLLUSCA 3 

Saunders, 1967 (Carboniferous), and Palmer and Brann, 1966 (Paleo- 
 cene and Eocene). These indices may contain more complete synonymies 
 than those included here, and should be consulted by interested workers. 
 Most of our specimens are from periods and areas covered by those 
 works. 

We have supplemented the originally published stratigraphic informa- 
 tion. We have expanded system names (for example, "Silurian") into 
 series names ("Middle Silurian"), and we have added stage names 
 ("Wenlock") or group names ("Midway Group") whenever possible. If 
 no source for the revision of stratigraphic nomenclature and correlation 
 was cited, we used either Berry and Boucot, 1970 (for Silurian), Palmer 
 and Brann, 1966 (for Paleocene and Eocene), or Keroher et al., 1%7 
 (for all other stratigraphic systems). 

Many published locality descriptions are brief, therefore we have sup- 
 plemented them whenever possible with data from the museum cata- 
 logues and on specimen labels. Locality information from sources other 
 than the original is cited as such. Important differences between the pub- 
 lished locality description and unpublished information in the museum 
 catalogues are noted. When published works indicate that a species was 
 found at several localities, we only list the locale where our specimen was 
 found. 

The individual "collections," such as the James Hall Collection, are 
 not sorted or stored separately. We list the collection name after the 
 locality description to give an indication how the specimen was obtained. 
 The previous catalogues in the series listed "lost" but not "missing" 
 specimens. Lost means that a specimen was destroyed by fire or lost in 
 the mails. Missing specimens are those not found while preparing this 
 catalogue. They are listed here and hopefully many of them will eventu- 
 ally be located.

Considerable confusion exists over the citation of American Museum 
 type numbers (Squires and Hawkins, 1958, pp. 1, 3). We have cited the 
 older Whitfield and Hovey (1898) numbers and also the newer "true"
