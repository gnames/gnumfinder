2 FIELDIANA: GEOLOGY, VOLUME 35 

Many specimens were originally described as "types," "cotypes," 
 "paratypes," or "syntypes." For these we have noted that holotypes 
 have not been designated, but should be chosen from the listed material. 
 All holotypes are listed as "by original designation," or if the author 
 clearly based his description on a single specimen, "by monotypy." 
 Lectotypes are designated as such. 

Although an artificial cast of a specimen has no nomenclatorial stand- 
 ing, it may be a useful tool when the original is lost. Therefore, without 
 implying that they are types, we list artificial casts of holotypes as "plas- 
 toholotypes"; "syn types," and "cotypes" as "plastocotypes"; and 
 figured specimens as "plastoplesiotypes." These casts figured "plasto-" 
 are made of various substances. We indicate the depository, when 
 known, of the original type for which we have a cast. 

The specific names of our specimens are listed as they were originally 
 published. In conformance with taxonomic practice, we have added, 
 when possible, the authorship and the date of publication of the 
 specific name. 

We have listed subsequent nomenclatorial changes affecting our types. 
 If these changes do not specifically refer to our specimen, they are listed 
 under "Remarks." If the fossil is a holotype, all subsequent nomencla- 
 torial changes refer to it. All re-assignments are cross-referenced. The 
 cross-references lead directly to the first name applied to our specimen. 

Within each section, the genera, and within each genus, the species, 
 are arranged alphabetically. Subgeneric names are ignored in alphabetiz- 
 ing the specimens. Therefore, a specimen described as Belleropon (Bel- 
 lerophon) chesterensis follows Bellerophon chesterensis. However, 
 Orthonychia mayesense WiW be with the "O's," while Platyceras (Ortho- 
 nychia) mayesense will be with the "P's." Subgeneric or subspecific 
 reassignments where they would lead to an entry immediately adjacent 
 are not cross-referenced. Similarly, misspellings of specific names are not 
 cross-referenced. 

Knight et al., 1960 have placed many generic names in synonymy (for 
 example, Coelocaulus = Michelia). For these, the cross-reference reads 
 ''Michelia spp. See: Coelocaulus spp." To provide new generic assign- 
 ments for nomina nuda and other unstudied material is beyond the scope 
 of this work. 

Species of authors (for example, "Aclisina sp.") follow all named 
 species in each genus, and are arranged chronologically. 

The literature, used in obtaining subsequent systematic changes, in- 
 cludes Bassler, 1915 (Ordovician and Silurian), unpublished biblio- 
 graphies by S. Weller and E. M. Kindle (Devonian), Yochelson and
