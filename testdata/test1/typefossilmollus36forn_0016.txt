numbers when available. The specimen numbers of other institutions 
 were obtained from Ball and Greacen, 1946 (CAS); Richards and Rams- 
 dell, 1962 (NJSM); Clarke and Ruedemann, 1903 (NYSM); Schuchert et 
 al., 1905 (USNM); and Hansman and Scott, 1967 (X). 

Many of the specimens in the Walker Museum were described and 
 figured in unpublished MS and Ph.D. theses written at the University of 
 Chicago. Such dissertations do not constitute valid publication under the 
 Rules of Zoological Nomenclature, and therefore their descriptions and 
 figures are not cited here. 

The University of Chicago published and distributed summaries of 
 Ph.D. theses submitted between 1922 and 1932 in a book-length serial 
 entitled Abstracts of Theses, Science Series. Specimens cited in these 
 abstracts are listed in our catalogue as referred specimens whenever the 
 specific name was previously established. The specimens referred to new 
 species in the Abstracts are usually nomina nuda, and create special 
 problems in listing them in this catalogue. For example, the thesis by 
 Wing (1923, unpub.) was never pubUshed in full, but only as an abstract 
 (Wing, 1925). Therefore, the 38 new specific names of gastropods listed 
 in the abstract are nomina nuda and are unavailable. Such invalid names 
 have been discussed in the literature (for example, Peel, 1972, p. 412), 
 and may be mentioned in the future. Therefore, we include the invalid 
 names with the notation "nomen nudum." 

Evans (1924, unpub.) described a Late Ordovician fauna from north- 
 eastern Illinois. The published abstract of his thesis (Evans, 1926) has a 
 faunal list that includes seven gastropod taxa. Although the abstract 
 contains many nomina nuda, none of them refers to gastropods. 

Bradley (1925) pubHshed a summary of his thesis in the Journal of 
 Geology. The summary contains many nomina nuda that became avail- 
 able upon the subsequent publication of his monograph (Bradley, 1930). 
 The 1930 monograph described only new species, while his (1924, un- 
 pub.) thesis and the published summary (1925) also list specimens re- 
 ferred to previously established taxa. Bradley (1927) published an ab- 
 stract of his thesis, but without mentioning any gastropods. 

Ball (in Flint and Ball, 1926, pp. 255-256) published a preliminary 
 faunal list based on his Ph.D thesis (Ball, 1927, unpub.), but did not 
 include any nomina nuda. Later, however, Ball (1928) published an 
 abstract of his thesis containing four gastropod nomina nuda with a 
 note: "to be published in full by the Missouri Geological Survey." 
 Although some parts of the thesis were eventually published, the gastro- 
 pod descriptions were not, and so the names remain unavailable.
